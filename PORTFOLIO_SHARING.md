# Portfolio Sharing Guide

## How Portfolio Sharing Works

Your portfolio application now supports sharing portfolios publicly! Here's how it works:

### 1. Setting Up Your Username

1. Go to your **Dashboard** â†’ **Profile**
2. Fill in the **Username** field (required for sharing)
3. Username requirements:
   - Must be at least 3 characters long
   - Can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
   - Must be unique across all users
4. Save your profile

### 2. Sharing Your Portfolio

Once you have a username set:

1. Go to your **Portfolio** page (`/portfolio`)
2. Click the **"Share Portfolio"** button
3. Your portfolio link will be copied to clipboard
4. Share this link with anyone: `https://yourdomain.com/portfolio/your-username`

### 3. Public Portfolio Viewing

Anyone with your portfolio link can:
- View your portfolio without needing to log in
- See all your projects, skills, experience, and education
- Access your social links and contact information
- Copy your portfolio link to share further

### 4. Portfolio URL Structure

- **Your private portfolio**: `/portfolio` (requires login)
- **Public portfolio**: `/portfolio/[username]` (no login required)

### 5. Features

- **Real-time username validation**: Check if username is available as you type
- **One-click sharing**: Copy portfolio link with a single click
- **Responsive design**: Works on all devices
- **SEO-friendly URLs**: Clean, shareable URLs
- **No authentication required**: Anyone can view public portfolios

### 6. Security

- Only profile information you choose to make public is visible
- Private dashboard remains protected
- Username must be unique to prevent conflicts
- All data is stored securely in Firebase

## Example Usage

1. User sets username: `john-doe`
2. Portfolio URL becomes: `https://myportfolio.com/portfolio/john-doe`
3. User clicks "Share Portfolio" button
4. Link is copied: `https://myportfolio.com/portfolio/john-doe`
5. Anyone can visit this URL to see the portfolio

## Troubleshooting

- **"Username is already taken"**: Choose a different username
- **"Please set a username"**: Complete your profile with a username first
- **Portfolio not found**: Check if the username is correct and the profile exists
