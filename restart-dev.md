# Development Server Restart Required

## Image Configuration Updated

The Next.js configuration has been updated to allow images from:
- `images.unsplash.com`
- `unsplash.com`
- `firebasestorage.googleapis.com`
- `lh3.googleusercontent.com`
- `avatars.githubusercontent.com`

## To Apply Changes

1. **Stop the development server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Restart the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Next.js Image Configuration**: Added Unsplash domains to allowed image sources
2. ✅ **Custom ProfileImage Component**: Created a robust image component with fallback handling
3. ✅ **Error Handling**: Improved image upload error handling and user feedback
4. ✅ **Image Optimization**: Only compress large images (>1MB) to improve performance
5. ✅ **Fallback Display**: Shows user initials or icon when image fails to load
6. ✅ **Loading States**: Added loading indicators during image upload

## Testing

After restarting the server:
1. Go to `/test-data` and create sample data
2. Check the profile page - images should load without errors
3. Try uploading a new profile picture
4. Visit the public portfolio - images should display properly

The image handling should now work seamlessly with both external URLs and Firebase Storage uploads!
